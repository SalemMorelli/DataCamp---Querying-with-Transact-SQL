~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Question 1

Use a subquery to get the product name and unit price of products from the Products table which have a 
unit price greater than the average unit price from the Order Details table.

Note that you need to use [Order Details] since the table name contains whitespace.

select ProductName, UnitPrice 
from Products
where UnitPrice >
(select AVG(UnitPrice) from [Order Details])
Order by ProductID;


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Question 2

Select from the Employees and Orders tables. Use a subquery to get the first
name and employee ID for employees who were associated with orders which shipped from the USA.


select FirstName, EmployeeID
from Employees
where EmployeeID in
(select EmployeeID from Orders where ShipCountry = 'USA')
order by EmployeeID;



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Question 3

Use the # to create a new temporary table called ProductNames which has one field called ProductName (a VARCHAR of max length 40).
Insert into this table the names of every product from the Products table. Note that there 
are two syntaxes for the INSERT INTO statement. Use the syntax that does not specify the column names since the table only has one field.
Select all columns from the ProductNames table you created.
