~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Inserting Products (1)
Each AdventureWorks product is stored in the SalesLT.Product table, and each product has a unique ProductID identifier, which is implemented as an IDENTITY column in the SalesLT.Product table.
Products are organized into categories, which are defined in the SalesLT.ProductCategory table.

The products and product category records are related by a common ProductCategoryID identifier, which is an IDENTITY column in the SalesLT.ProductCategory table.

The new product to be inserted is shown in this table:

IMPORTANT NOTE before you start this chapter:

In order to run all separate queries in a SQL script, make sure to end each statement with a ;.
DataCamp will only return the result of the last query in your script.
Your database-altering statements will not persist, so you can keep experimenting over and over.

AdventureWorks has started selling the new product shown in the table above. Insert it into the SalesLT.Product table, using default or NULL values for unspecified columns.
Once you've inserted the product, run SELECT SCOPE_IDENTITY(); to get the last identity value that was inserted.
Add a query to view the row for the product in the SalesLT.Product table.

-- Finish the INSERT statement
INSERT INTO SalesLT.Product (Name, ProductNumber, StandardCost, ListPrice, ProductCategoryID, SellStartDate)
VALUES
('LED Lights', 'LT-L123', 2.56, 12.99, 37, GETDATE());

-- Get last identity value that was inserted
SELECT SCOPE_IDENTITY();

-- Finish the SELECT statement
Select * FROM SalesLT.Product
WHERE ProductID = SCOPE_IDENTITY();
