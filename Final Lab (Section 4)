~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Question 1

Use CHOOSE() and MONTH() to get the season in which each order was shipped from the Orders table. You should select the
order ID, shipped date, and then the season aliased as ShippedSeason. You can copy and paste the below into your query.

'Winter', 'Winter', 'Spring', 'Spring', 'Spring', 'Summer', 'Summer', 'Summer', 'Autumn', 'Autumn', 'Autumn', 'Winter'

Be careful to filter out any NULL shipped dates.

select OrderID, ShippedDate, CHOOSE(MONTH(ShippedDate), 'Winter', 'Winter', 'Spring', 'Spring', 'Spring', 'Summer', 
'Summer', 'Summer', 'Autumn', 'Autumn', 'Autumn', 'Winter') as ShippedSeason
from Orders
where ShippedDate IS NOT NULL;
